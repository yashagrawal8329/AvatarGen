## 🌟 Project Overview

AvatarGen is a simple, web-based application designed to generate customizable digital avatars from text prompts. Built as a proof-of-concept during an AI/ML internship, this system leverages state-of-the-art **Stable Diffusion** technology to create high-quality, stylized images across various themes (e.g., Realistic, Anime, Cyberpunk).

**Key Features:**

* **Text-to-Image Generation:** Convert detailed text prompts into unique avatars.
* **Style Control:** Select from pre-defined styles using prompt templates for consistent results.
* **Batch Generation:** Generate 4 variations simultaneously using different random seeds.
* **Gradio UI:** Simple, interactive interface for easy use and sharing.
